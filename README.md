# hello-world
My name is Wally & I'm an aspiring developer! Having learned Python, SQL, and R in college - I'm not totally new to writing code, but it admittedly has been a while since I sat down and tried to build something.
I'm excited to delve back into the world of data & machine learning!
Currently, I work as a product manager focused exclusively on AI/ML capabilities.
While I don't see that changing in the immediate/near future, I would like to develop a deeper sense of fluency and understanding about machine learning by working on projects to build models & tools for myself.
After all, what use is a leader who can't hang in the trenches?

Anyway, looking forward to more fun!

This repository is for getting familiar with Github :)
